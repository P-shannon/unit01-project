# Delvers: Curses of Risk and Rewards Proposal

## What is Delvers?
>A game about managing talent, resources, and risk as you fight through dungeons in turn-based combat, featuring permanent death.

I enjoy games that require thought and also crank up the stakes way high. The idea of consenquence is a big focus in the rouge-like genre, but it's not really prominant in other genres. I'd like to see some high stakes and punishment in a seemingly complicated turn based game that'll hopefully be optimized for mobile screens.

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure
This project, especially with the given timeframe will not be easy. I will need to create a lot of interfaces; character menus, equipments, spells, team settings, locations, a main menu, a combat screen, and a lot of other things depending on how much progress I make. Not to mention the actual game logic, I'll have to manage a modular style of having entities take turns making actions, I'll also have to manage a database or proceedurally generate the various items that will be found in the game. The monsters that will be fought and the various bosses will need consideration and the rabit hole only gets deeper. I sometimes feel like this might be too ambitious, but I'm a little tired of not pushing myself to my limit for things that I actually want to do.

## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)

## Links and Resources

(Anything you've looked up so far or are thinking about using.)
